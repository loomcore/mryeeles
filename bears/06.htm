	and pointy claws.  They have 42 teeth. If a grizzly bear is living
	in the wild it will live for around 25 years.  Bears can run up to
	35 miles per hour.  A cub would stay with thare mother for a

	Bears live in forests near softly flowing rivers. They only like
	to be around other bears of thare type.  They live by rivers to
	catch fish for food. Bears can move through fast flowing rivers very
	easily.  Bears are mostly found in America.  The bears can come out
	the forest through the differant types of trees then catch thare prey
	with thare incredibly long muzzle.

	Bears shred thare food with thare mouths before they eat it.  They
	mainly eat fish and baby deer.  They catch the fish by putting thare
	long muzzle into the water and incredibly quickly catch the fish.
	As a treat they eat nuts and berries.  Bears can also eat the sap
	from inside the trees.  Bears get the sap by using thare strong
	claws to break the bark on the tree.  When bears are in the
	forest they sometimes will eat little insects.  They eat around
	13.5 kg a day.
