	<h2 style="color: Blue;">Characteristics</h2>

	<p>
	Grizzly bears are large land animals that live in North America.
	Even though they are very large and can weigh up to 1,500 pounds
	they can run up to 40 mph.  Even though they look very cute and
	cuddly they are the largest land animals and have very sharp
	canines. Most people think that grizzly bears can only be brown
	but they can be all sorts of colours including brown, black,
	gold and even white.  Bears plumpen up in the summer to get
	ready for hibernation in the winter. They have 2 layers of skin
	and a dog like muzzle with big round ears on their head.

	<p>
		Grizzly bears survive on the fish that they catch in the river
		and they catch salmon to eat. They shred them up into small
		parts with their sharp claws. They need a river near their
		home to catch fish in but if they have to, they will eat
		berrys, insects and moths. Bears are omnivores because they
		eat berrys as well as fish.

<h2 style="color: orange;">Habitat</h2>

	<p>
		They live in North America in big forests near rivers. They
		live alone apart from with their cubs (baby bears) or mothers. They don't in the open for they
		find food in the forests. Bears usally hibernate in winter
		in caves to keep warm.
