	<h1>Facts all about Grizzly bears</h1>

	<h2>Characteristics</h2>

	<p>
	   Baby Grizzly bears are called cubs. Cubs live with their mother for a few years. They are really strong and powerful. They use their knife-like teeth to tear
       their food in bits, but unlike other bears they eat plants and insects.Their life is quite long, extending to 20-25 years. They also use their claws to catch 
   prey and tear food. To suvive cold winters ther have a thick layer of fur. Grizzly bears are intelligent and can run really quick, up to 35 mph. The really 
	   weird thing about Grizzly bears is that unlike most bears, they can't climb trees. Grizzly bears are known for being the biggest carnivor in America.
