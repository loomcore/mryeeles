	<h2>Diet</h2>
	<p>
	  Bengal tigers are carnivorous mammals, this means they only eat meat. Bengal tigers often kill medium-sized mammals like pigs and deer. Sometimes tigers eat farm animals,
	which brings them into close contact with humans. However, tigers only kill around 85 people per year.  This is because humans are not part of a tiger's diet.
