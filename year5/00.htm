		   <p>		Naked mole rats have a body length between 8 and 9cms and a tail length between 3 and 4.5cms 
         Also they weigh between 30 and 80g.They spend most of their life <strong>underground</strong>.Their 
		colour is pink yellowish.They have a cilindrical shaped body and tiny limbs that are
   	    made for burrow living.They live from 13-18 years.Their skin is almost hairless.They have  
        large teeth used for digging and they keep their lips close to their teeth to prevent soil
	    from getting in.Naked mole rats can cut or scrape their skin and not feel anything.They are cold blooded.
         They are also known as<em> sand puppys</em>.Sensory whiskers on the nose and tail help them navigate darck 
		 underground tunnels.Naked mole rats are related to Guinea pigs and porcupines.Why are they naked? Native to the desert regions of East Africa, which can be pretty warm during the day, naked mole-rats live in burrows underground. 
If it does get cold at night, the little mammals just huddle together in a mole-rat pile and use each other's body heat to keep warm. 
And since they spend their lives underground, they don't need hair for sun protection. 
It's hard to see, but naked Naked mole-rats do have about 100 fine hairs on their body that act like whiskers to help them feel what's around them. 
Hairs between their toes help sweep soil behind them while tunneling.Not a mole, not a rat: The forbidding environment of East Africa’s deserts is home to one of the most bizarre rodents, the naked mole-rat. 
These beauties wouldn’t win any pageants, but they are fascinating animals. 
Yes, these odd little creatures with pink, wrinkly skin dig and live in underground burrows the way moles do. Yes, they have skinny, rat-like tails. 
Yet naked mole-rats are more closely related to porcupines, chinchillas, and guinea pigs than they are to moles or rats and are the only species of 
mole-rat that has practically no hair.

	Naked mole-rats front teeth also help them tunnel through dirt while looking for these food items. They are able to get enough moisture from their diet
	so they don’t need to dig for water as well.   
 
	
	<p>
   	    Predominantly sourthen Ethopia,Kenya and Somalia.They live in burrows in arid African <em>deserts</em>.
   A Naked mole-rat colony may have from 20 to 300 individuals living in an underground area that can be as large as 6 football fields! 
   It is filled with a tunnel system that stays at a warm temperature of 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) 
   even though the outside temperature can get much colder or warmer. To keep the colony healthy and safe, there are chambers, or rooms 
   at different points along the tunnel system. They live in colonies of 75-80 individuals,although it is not unknown for up to 300 
   to live in 1 colony.They live in a complex stystem of burrows that cumulatively can be 3-4.5kms.Why are they "naked"? Native to the desert regions of East Africa, which can be pretty warm during the day, naked mole-rats live underground. 
If it does get cold at night, the little mammals just huddle together in a mole-rat pile and use each other's body heat to keep warm. 
And since they spend their lives underground, they don't need hair for sun protection. 
It's hard to see, but naked mole-rats do have about 100 fine hairs on their body that act like whiskers to help them feel what's around them. 
Hairs between their toes help sweep soil behind them while tunneling.Every single area or chamber has a perpose. 
There is a nesting area,a nursery area even a loo area.

	Naked mole rats eat their own poo it is disgusting but true.They also gather the roots and bulbs for the colony to eat.
	Naked mole rats are Hibervores.They eat their poo for an exelent reason it helps with digeston.
	Amazingly they will feed on a tuber and leave a bit,then block their tunnel of to allow the tuber to regenerate. 
	Naked mole-rats are found where there are plants with large underground roots and tubers. 
	Eating these tough foods requires some pretty strong and sharp teeth.
	 Naked mole-rats’ front teeth also help them tunnel through dirt while looking for these food items. 
	 They are able to get enough moisture from their diet, so they don’t need to dig for water as well. 
	 Like all rodents, these teeth continue to grow, but by gnawing on hard things, they keep their teeth from getting too long! 
	 Naked mole-rats can move their front teeth independently, spreading them apart and moving them together, like a pair of chopsticks.

<p>
Almost all Naked mole rats live alone.But the Naked mole-rat and the Damaraland mole-rat are the only two mammal species that are eusocial (yew SO shul).
 This means they live in a colony that may have several generations living together and just a few individuals that produce all the offspring for 
 the colony, much the way bees and ants live. 
 Scientists believe the naked mole-rats' eusocial behavior is due to the challenges of living underground in the desert, where there is little food or water.

<p>
A Naked mole rats colony is enormous the largest it can be is asd large as 6 grassy football pitches.To keep the colony healthy and safe, there are areas, or chambers, 
at different points along the tunnel system.

<p>
The majority of people have a theory that Naked mole rats' are blind.Although their eyes aren't much use underground, but they can still see a little bit. 
Plus they mostly rely on their other senses aswell.The other senses would be hearing,smell,touch and taste they aren't really concerned about their eyesight. 
Their behaveiour doesn't change in light or dark inviourments.
