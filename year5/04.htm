<h1 strong>Scarlet Macaw</strong></h1>

	<h2>What are Scarlet Macaws like?</h2>
	
	<p>	 
	    Scarlet Macaws are very energetic and <em>filled</em> with personality! They are also very capable of escaping nets.
		Though easily trainable even the tamest can bite! But if not trained otherwise a Scarlet Macaw could become a one-person bird.
		A Scarlet can be up to 32 to 39 inches! Just <em>imagine</em> being a bird of that length! With it's magnificent size a
        Scarlet is the largest parrot species in <em>the world!</em> Also, if you look close enough you will be able to see the yellow 
        band that is on it's wings. The Scarlet Macaw's beak is so strong that it can even break a person's nuckles!

	<h2>Scarlet Habitats</h2>

	<p>
		 
        The Scarlet Macaw lives in the tropical rain forests of Mexico, Bolivia, Peru and the small island of Trinidad. The Scarlet Macaw 
		lives mostly in tropical rain forests like the Amazon but sometimes can be found in forests along rivers and grasslands with a humid 
		climate and tall trees. The pretty parrots will use the trees to bulid their nests where they will lay their 1 to 4 eggs each year!

        <h2>Snacktime!</h2>
		
		<p>  
		
		The Scarlet Macaw is an omnivore, meaning it can eat both meat <em>and</em> plants. It eats many things such as fruit, Brazillian nuts, larvae
		insects, flowers, snails, leaves, and yes, some Scarlets have been seen eating <em><strong>clay!</em></strong>    With it's <strong>strong</strong>
		hooked beak it can easily break nuts and incredibly, a Scarlet can eat fruits and berries toxic enough to kill other animals! Now that is simply 
		extraordinary!

	  <h2>Oh no! They're disappearing!</h2>
	  
	  
	  <p>
	  
	  Yes sadly, the Scarlets are endangered! This is due to being stolen from their nests and and sold illegally for $200 in places 
	  like Costa Rica. In the USA baby scarlets are smuggled into the country and sold for up to $4,000! Tourists pay $14,000 a year to go see
	  Scarlet Macaws in the wild. They are also eaten by jaguars and the trees in their forests are being cut down (also known as deforestation).
