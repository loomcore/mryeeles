<p>Black rats eat plants also humans' waste(thats rubbish, not poo and wee). They can also feast upon old fruit that has
been thrown away like old banana skins and orange peels. They also eat grain from the fields. Not to mention titbits of ancient wheat
and yucky, distusting bits of seed. The black rat's predators are domestic cats and gigantic birds like eagles. They eat by lifting the food to their mouth
with their two front paws then nibbling the titbits in chunks. </p>
